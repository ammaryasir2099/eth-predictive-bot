## ??? Build Windows EXE from Python Script using PyInstaller

This guide will help you package the trading bot into a `.exe` file using **PyInstaller**, so users without Python can run it easily.

---

### ? Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Install Python (if not installed)**

* Download and install Python 3.10+ from the official site:
  ?? [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* During install, **check the box**: ? *“Add Python to PATH”*

---

#### 2. **Install Required Packages**

Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you are in the same folder as the `requirements.txt`.

---

#### 3. **Install PyInstaller**

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

---

#### 4. **Prepare the `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the same folder with the following:

```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

> ?? Replace `your_api_key` and `your_api_secret` with your real Binance API credentials.

---

#### 5. **Build the Executable**

In the terminal, run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile your_script_name.py
```

For example:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile eth_autobot.py
```

* This creates a `dist/` folder containing `eth_autobot.exe`
* You can now share this `.exe` file with anyone — no Python required!

---

### ?? Final Folder Structure (Recommended)

```
/your-bot-folder/
¦
+-- eth_autobot.py
+-- .env
+-- requirements.txt
+-- README.md
+-- dist/
    +-- eth_autobot.exe
```

---

### ?? Important Notes

* If your bot logs data or accesses other files, be sure they are **included** or created at runtime.
* PyInstaller supports custom icons with `--icon=icon.ico`
* Disable console window (GUI only) with `--noconsole` if needed

---

### ? Run the Bot

Double-click `eth_autobot.exe` or run from terminal:

```bash
dist\eth_autobot.exe
```

> It will start fetching ETH price and placing trades using your Binance Futures account.
